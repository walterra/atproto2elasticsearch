# Versioning

This project follows Semantic Versioning (SemVer).

- **Major**: breaking changes or incompatible behavior
- **Minor**: new features that are backward compatible
- **Patch**: bug fixes and documentation updates

Pre-release versions are marked with `-alpha`, `-beta`, or `-rc`. The 1.0.0 release will remove the pre-release tag and indicate a stable API.

# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This is a single-maintainer project. Only the latest release is supported on a best-effort basis.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please use GitHub Security Advisories if possible:

If you cannot use a security advisory, open a GitHub issue with minimal details so we can coordinate a private report.
